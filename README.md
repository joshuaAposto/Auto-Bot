## üìù Note
- This is a messenger chat bot using a personal account, using an unofficial API, and this may lead to Facebook accounts being locked due to spam or other reasons.
- So, I recommend using a clone or dummy account (one that you're willing to throw away at any time).
- I am not responsible for any problems that may arise from using this bot.

## üìù Step by Step Tutorial
1. To get Appstate to fill the app state form, please follow these steps:
   - Download C3C-FBState [c3c-fbstate-master](https://codeload.github.com/c3cbot/c3c-fbstate/zip/refs/heads/master).

   - Open Kiwi Browser and tap on the three dots at the top right corner.
   - Select extensions from the menu.
   - Tap on + from (.zip/ .crx/ .user.js) and choose the file "c3c-fbstate-master.zip" that you downloaded.
   - Once the extension is added, go to www.facebook.com and log in to the account you want to use as a bot.
   - After logging in, tap on the three dots again and scroll down to find the C3C FBState Utility 1.5.
   - Click on it and then click on copy clipboard.
   - Paste the copied data into the Appstate form in [Hashbot](https://autobot.hashier-holmes.repl.co/).
   - Finally, toggle check and submit Appstate to initiate the bot and restart the website once the appstate is successfully submitted.
